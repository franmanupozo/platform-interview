# 🚀 Form3 Platform Interview – Terraform Refactor

## 🎯 Objective

Refactor the Terraform infrastructure to:
- Reduce code duplication.
- Simplify adding or removing services or environments.
- Introduce a new environment called **`staging`**.

---

## 🧩 Design Overview

The `main.tf` file defines the **environments** (`development`, `production`, `staging`) and the **services** (`account`, `gateway`, `payment`).  
Each service is instantiated using the **`service` module**, which abstracts the logic for:

- Creating secrets in Vault.  
- Creating policies and authentication users in Vault.  
- Deploying the corresponding Docker containers.

Terraform uses `for_each` loops to dynamically generate all resources for each service and environment combination.  
This structure allows you to easily extend the system without repeating code.

CI/CD Integration
Example CI/CD pipeline steps:
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan


Production Considerations
For a production-ready setup, consider the following improvements:
Use a remote backend (e.g., AWS S3 + DynamoDB lock) instead of local state files.
Avoid hardcoding Vault tokens — use environment variables (TF_VAR_vault_token) or secure secret management.
Add linting and validation tools such as tflint, terraform fmt, and terraform validate.
